### Maintenance 4.0: Preactive Maintenance
 - Optimize maintenance and service logistics by means of data  analysis.
 - integrate sensors in maintenance processes
 - data -> knowledge -> optimize maintenance proc. 
### Applications
 - __Ballast water tanks__. Assess corrosion state of critical components during operation. Extend operating life. 
 - Expertise to choose sensors for harsh environment.
 - Ability to extend system with sensors, without further effort
