## BIBA

### Bremer Institut für Produktion und Logistik 

- Scientific engineering research Institute and performs application-oriented and industrial research by facing technological and organisational challenges. 
- The conducted research projects are related to the scope of Industry 4.0. 
- ghr@biba.uni-bremen.de


### Maintenance 4.0: Preactive Maintenance
 - Optimize maintenance and service logistics by means of data  analysis.
 - integrate sensors in maintenance processes
 - data -> knowledge -> optimize maintenance proc. 
### Applications
 - __Ballast water tanks__. Assess corrosion state of critical components during operation. Extend operating life. 
 - Expertise to choose sensors for harsh environment.
 - Ability to extend system with sensors, without further effort
